## Operating System

I am currently using [Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/). Sometimes I have to use Microsoft Office or need to test my web apps in Safari. Therefore, I have a Windows and a Mac OS VM.

## Hardware

I am mainly using three keyboards. The one of my laptop, a custom build DZ60 with Cherry MX Silent Browns and a Lily58 Pro with Aliaz Silents.

I use two mices a Logitech MX Master 2S and a Kensington SlimBlade Trackball.

## Coding Environment

I use [neovim](https://neovim.io) in combination with tmux and zsh as my primary coding environment. You can find my  dotfiles [here](https://github.com/mikebarkmin/.dotfiles).

Firefox has been my main browser since I move everything to Linux back in 2010.

## Desktop Apps

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is my go-to app for notetaking and knowledge management.
- [Gimp](https://gimp.org) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) are my favorite tool for designing everything.
- I am also using a bunch of other desktop apps, which you can find in my [Ublue configuration](https://github.com/mikebarkmin/silberblau/blob/live/config/yafti.yml)

## Backup Strategy

I use a managed [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.org) instance called [Storage Share](https://www.hetzner.com/de/storage/storage-share) from Hetzner.

I am also trying to keep my system immutable by using my custom Fedora Silverblue image. You can find it [here](https://github.com/mikebarkmin/silberblau).
